<h2>Top 3 Romance movies!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>#1 The Notebook.</h3>
<p>Amazing story about a man that loves his wife so much that after she is diagnosed with alzheimer, he meets with here everyday to tell her their love story.</p>
<h3>#2 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</h3>
<p>I find this one good because, not only plays with our imagination as the main character is born old and as he "grows" he gets younger. This movie shows this magical love that goes beyond appearances.</p>
<h3>#3 Anyone but you.</h3>
<p>A comic romance, two people that hit it off one night but due to a misunderstanding, nothing actually happened till "destiny" got them together once more. Funny and with touching moments.</p>
